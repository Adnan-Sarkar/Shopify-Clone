# Shopify Clone with Tailwind CSS 

Hello There,

I'm `Adnan Sarkar`. This is the `Shopify clone` assignment in my [Full Stack Javascript](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) course. Where I designed this page using HTML & Tailwind CSS only. This design is responsive for all devices. Now, I'm strongly confident to do any website responsive with HTML & Tailwind CSS.
